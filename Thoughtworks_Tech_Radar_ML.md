## Techniques

#### Trial

[Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201904066) -- End-to-end cycles of development, deploying and monitoring machine learning models

[Ethical bias testing](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911054) -- understand the predictions of a ML classifier.

[Semi-supervised learning loops](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911052) -- iterative ML workflows that take advantage of the relationships to be found in unlabeled data.

[Transfer learning for NLP](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201904062) 

#### Assess

[Data mesh](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911051) -- ML over decentralized data

[DeepWalk](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=202005085) -- Apply machine learning on object graphs

## Tools

#### Trial

[DVC](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools?blipid=202005061) -- Data version control

[Experiment tracking tools for machine learning](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools?blipid=201911042) -- keep track of the experiments and work through them methodically

[Manifold](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools?blipid=202005100) -- Model-agnostic visual debugger for machine learning.

## Platforms

#### Assess

[Google BigQuery ML](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms?blipid=202005040) - Brings model to data (sort of serverless ML for data stored in BigQuery).

[JupyterLab](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms?blipid=202005034) -- an evolution of Jupyter Notebook

[Stratos](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms?blipid=202005037) -- create haptic feedback in mid-air.  A use case is responding to a driver's hand gesture.

## Languages & Frameworks

#### Trial

[PyTorch](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks?blipid=1172) -- ML Library. Used wdiely for computer vision and NLP. Competitors to TensorFlow. 

[Deequ](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks?blipid=202005024) -- Data quality validation. unit tests for data.

[ERNIE]() -- Continual pre-training framework for NLP ??
